        <h2>Roles + Deliverables + Tools</h2>
        <p>I led the design of Virtual Musem’s platform (both the exhibits and website) on desktop applications, including efforts to improve the platform through user research, prototype mockups with Figma, and usability tests. Deliverables included images, icons, prototype mockups of the app, logos, and a style guide.</p>

        <p>Virtual Museum brings you high quality immersive experiences on a range of topics based on art and history. Explore anything from the history of vampiric lore to Pop Art on Virtual Museum. These exhibits are personal, interactive, and engaging. We will explore how I created the exhibit on Francisco Goya in this case study.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 1: The Survey</h2>
        <p class="list-spacing">Using a survey I conducted of 16 participants, I found that the majority of users want the following interactive features in the exhibit:</p>
        <ul class="fa-ul">
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i></span>Trivia questions asking about art or history concept</li>

        <p>A competitive analysis of Google Arts and Culture and the British Museum showed a lot of opportunities in the visual aspects of Virtual Museum.</p>

        <img src="./images/google-arts-culture.png" alt="Competitive analysis screenshot for Google Arts and Culture exhibit on Mona Lisa">

        <p class="spacing">Google Arts and Culture has a lot of fun, interactive, and informative content that inspired the Goya exhibit. Zooming in on certain features on a painting, the scroll journey, content readability, and engaging writing are things that Google Arts and Culture does well.</p>
        <p>However, one drawback I noticed with Google Arts and Culture that could benefit Virtual Museum was offering content on a website rather than an app. Only offering content on an app could deter users.</p>

       <h2>CHAPTER 4: The User Stories</h2>
       <p class="list-spacing">It was important to keep user stories as simple as possible since the product was about a user journey through art and history. Overcomplicating this would defeat the purpose of Virtual Museum. Simplicity as well as the needs I identified through personas, the survey, and competitive analysis produced the following user stories for the MVP:</p>
       <ul class="fa-ul">

        <p>The open-ended question wireframe went through the most adjustment. It made more sense for the open-ended questions to be included within the actual Goya exhibit rather than as another link in the Virtual Museum website, so I removed the Open-Ended section from the menu links.</p>

        <h3>PART 3: BRANDING</h3>
        <h2>CHAPTER 8: The Logo + Colors + Typography</h2>
        <p>Virtual Museum’s brand intersects art with technology. It combines the old with the new to transform experiences and make visitors engage more deeply with the exhibits.</p>
        <div class="project-logo">
        <img src="./images/vm-black-logo.svg" alt="Virtual Museum's black logo">
        </div>
        <p class="spacing">I chose the name Virtual Museum because to capture a real museum essence. Even though the tone of the site is lighthearted, the brand still conveys an academic feel. The logo draws upon classic museum logos that exist. It is sleek and minimal with a lot of authority.</p>
        <p>The exhibits are fun and interactive, and the logo complements this by showing that the site is also a serious educational platform, like real museums. Playfair Display and  PT Mono complement each other. They show that there’s a place for technology and history to interact.</p>
        <div class="project-logo">
        <img src="./images/vm-white-logo.svg" alt="Virtual Museum's white logo ">
        </div>
        <p>The brand is two-fold: internal and external. The internal brand is sleek, minimal, and black and white so the exhibit branding can take precedence. This external color branding will be based on the specific exhibit at the time, but the typography stays the same.</p>

        <h2>Internal + External Branding</h2>
        <p>The internal branding, the branding for Virtual Museum's website, is minimalist to give precedence to the branding of the exhibits. "Chiaroscuro" and "Etching" are subtle enough to give more presence to the exhibits.</p>
        <div class="colors">
        <img src="./images/vm-colors.svg" alt="Internal brand colors for Virtual Museum">
        </div>

        <p>The external brand colors for the Goya exhibit come from some of his most popular paintings to match the atmosphere of the portraits that the exhibit showcases.</p>

        <p>In the end, I decided that scrolling page by page would make the information much easier to digest and not overwhelm users as much. This format also makes the interactive components like trivia more engaging.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 11: The Preference Test</h2>
        <p class="list-spacing">Once I figured that it would be better for users to scroll page by page, I had to figure out how to situate them within the exhibit. How would they know which section they were on? What if they wanted to easily go back to the main Virtual Museum website? I preference tested three different formats to situate users:</p>
        <ul class="fa-ul padding">
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i></span>a side menu that pops out once you click it</li>
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i></span>a stationary timeline on the side</li>
          <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i></span>a navbar that includes the Virtual Museum website</li>

        <h2>CHAPTER 12: The High-Fidelity Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>In the original prototype before testing, I didn’t incorporate arrows to show users how to get to the next part because two arrows (one for the menu popout and one to indicate the next section) looked too busy.</p>
        <div class="high-fidelity">
        <img src="./images/vm-exhibit.png" alt="First exhibit mockup shows an arrow">
        <p class="spacing">However, testing with Jessica showed me that an arrow was necessary. Because there were three arrows in the beginning to indicate to users that they must click or scroll to the next page, Jessica assumed that the side arrow was the arrow to use to go to the next page.</p>
        <p>To fix this issue, I then incorporated a bottom arrow on each frame that you can see only once your mouse hovers over it.</p>

        <h3>PART 5: FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
        <h2>CHAPTER 13: The Epilogue</h2>
        <p class="spacing">Testing showed positive reactions towards the product. Users enjoyed the look, feel, and engaging content in the Goya exhibit. The trivia component was a success.</p>
        <p class="spacing">Virtual Museum’s website was also well received. All three user testing showed that it was intuitive to use and explore through different exhibits.</p>
        <p class="spacing">If I could redo some things with Virtual Museum, I would conduct more research around the audience, especially as they relate to the COVID-19 pandemic since more people are at home.</p>
        <p>Figuring this out could be especially helpful for marketing and branding for Virtual Museum.</p>
