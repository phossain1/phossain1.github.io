        <h2>Roles + Deliverables + Tools</h2>
        <p>I led the design of Scribble’s platform on desktop applications, including efforts to improve the platform through user research, prototype mockups with Figma and Invision, and usability tests. Deliverables included images, icons, prototype mockups of the app, logos, and a style guide.</p>

        <h2>What is Scribble?</h2>
        <p>EC Production believes that the cloud storage and organization market hasn’t reached its full potential yet. The organization wanted to explore new, more dynamic ways to take advantage of this growing market by finding the right features to meet the right audience. Thus, Scribble was born, a fresh cloud storage platform for writing projects.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>We needed a new target audience, differentiating features, and a brand in the cloud storage space. Once we discovered that students filled a niche in this market, the pain points for users were:</p>
          <ul class="problem">
          <li>not having enough collaborative features,</li>
          <li>difficult organization,</li>
          <li>and difficulty accessing writing projects.</li>

        <p>Scribble solves the problem by including effective collaborative features, efficient organization through folders, and access to other writing projects via Google Drive and OneDrive.</p>

        <p>Using a survey we conducted of 15 participants, we found a niche market within students and education, specifically with regards to writing projects. The following are questions we asked about what collaborative, organizational, and app syncing features users wanted in a cloud storage system.</p>

       <h3>PART 2: INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
       <h2>CHAPTER 4: The User Stories</h2>
       <p>User stories are based on most frequent tasks as well as what users wanted most out of a cloud storage system. We identified these key processes to focus on for Scribble’s prototype:</p>
       <div class="lists">

       <p>User flows are based on the user stories we identified above. The one below is a task regarding a collaborative feature identified through the user survey - a lead team member allocating tasks in the margin for group work.</p>

       <img src="./images/flowsketch.png" alt="userflowsketch">

        <h2>CHAPTER 6: The Wireframe Sketches</h2>
        <p>Using all of the processes listed in user flows, wireframes reflected the simple nature of Scribble. The dashboard wireframe went through the most adjustment. It was refined to include sidebars to anchor sections. This improved the dashboard’s usability (discussed later).</p>

        <h3>PART 3: BRANDING</h3>
        <h2>CHAPTER 8:The Logo + Colors + Typography</h2>
        <p>Scribble's brand is to be fresh and inspirational, just like a new idea.</p>
        <div class="scribble">
        <img src="./images/sketchlogo.png" alt="sketch">
        </div>
        <div class="scribble">
        <img src="./images/scribblelogos.png" alt="logos">
        </div>
        <p>We chose Scribble because it conveys the brainstorming phase of an idea, the birth of a project or portfolio, and the beginnings of something exciting. A scribble can start small and end big. The logo incorporates a pencil connected to a scribble to show that ideas can be fickle at first, but it’s all part of the process.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>To appeal to a younger, academic, and often stressed writer population, branding involved soft, muted, and modern colors to cultivate a relaxed, but studious atmosphere.</p>
        <div class="colors">
        <img src="./images/colors.png" alt="colors">
        </div>

        <div class="typography">
        <h2 class="color-white-center">Typography</h2>
        <p class="color-white">The typography matches this idea by being fresh, inspirational, and nurturing. The brand uses fonts that are old and new. Innovation and creation is often a revamping of old ideas. That’s why the fonts incorporate a serif brand typeface, Libre Baskerville, that pays homage to old writing and fonts and a more familiar geometric style font, Montserrat, to complement. Scribble is primarily meant to foster writing projects as well, which is why we incorporated a more literary feel to the typeface.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 10: The High-Fidelity Mockups</h2>
        <p>High fidelity mockups brought Scribble’s branding to the wireframes. Many aspects were adjusted in the high fidelity mockups after user testing such as: </p>
        <img src="./images/bulletlist2.png" alt="list">
        <p>We  incorporated a Google button to standardize the Google sign-in process. In addition, we changed the sign up button for better contrast.</p>

        <img src="./images/signup1.png" alt="signup1">
        </div>
        <p>We cleaned up the dashboard with a sleek navbar, easily identifiable links on the side, easily identifiable folders, actionable buttons, more immediate tasks on the right side, and a multitude of icons for a better visual aesthetic. The newer design is a more organized and user friendly dashboard.</p>

        <h3>PART 5: FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
        <h2>CHAPTER 13: The Epilogue</h2>
        <p>Users seemed satisfied with the general feel of the platform. Although we had initial doubts about the branding not being assertive enough, it worked in favor of the target audience who were receptive to it. The allocating task feature was also a popular one for the platform.</p>
        <div class="icons">
        <img src="./images/pencils.png" alt="pencils">
        </div>
        <p>Even though we worked and reworked the dashboard, if given more time, we would have spent more energy researching and testing for this screen. We went through the most iterations with the look and feel of the dashboard, but if given more time, we might play with anchoring the sidebar with a different color or texture.</p>
        <p>More consistent icons and CTAs would also increase Scribble’s usability. For future projects, the dashboard will be tested and retested to ensure optimal usability of a product. </p>
